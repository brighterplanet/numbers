Last weekend we were proud to sponsor another round of the fantastic [EcoHackNYC](http://www.ecohacknyc.org/) green hackathon event.

It's always amazing to see another crop of apps for the environment emerge over the course of just one day. Personally, I worked with a team on [CSA Builder](http://csabuilder.herokuapp.com/), a tool for local food organizations to figure out where to establish CSA pick-up locations for maximum effect.

Look forward to next time!

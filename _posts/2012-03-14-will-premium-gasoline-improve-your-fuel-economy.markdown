This morning's NPR marketplace included a list of [money-saving tips for drivers](http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/tips-making-most-your-gas-money). Most are spot-on, but one surprised me: the recommendation that everyone use 91 octane premium gasoline.

Numerous sources including the [Federal Trade Commission](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/autos/aut12.shtm), [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fact-or-fiction-premium-g), and the [California Energy Commission](http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/transportation/consumer_tips/regular_vs_premium.html) have debunked the myth that a higher octane rating will give you a performance boost or keep your engine cleaner. Possibly alluding to this, the tip claims that premium gasoline is better "because it's more filtered, not because of the octane."

Since [all grades of gasoline have the same energy content](http://data.brighterplanet.com/automobile_fuels) I'm skeptical that any slight difference in purity could make up for a roughly 7% price premium.

My take: follow the other tips but stick with regular unleaded.

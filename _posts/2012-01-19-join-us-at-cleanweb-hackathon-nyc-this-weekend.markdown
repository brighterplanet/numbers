As usual, we'll be holding a series of Healthy Hacker activities over the course of the weekend. (Above is a [shot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jatorre/6316189868/in/photostream) of the Healthy Hacker yoga class we held during EcoHackNYC in November.)

If you want a spot, make sure to put your name on the list first thing in the morning, as space will be limited.

![Liquiteria cup](/images/liquiteria.png){.wrapped} At 3pm we're going to have fresh cold-pressed detox juices delivered by NYC's famous [Liquiteria](http://liquiteria.com).

If you haven't signed up for the Hackathon, all the more reason to [sign up now!](http://cleanwebhack.com/hackathon/)

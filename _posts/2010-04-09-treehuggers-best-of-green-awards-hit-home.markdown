<!-- 		@page { margin: 0.79in } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.08in } 		A:link { so-language: zxx } -->TreeHugger has just announced the “Best of Green” awards.  And we're proud and thrilled to see that Brighter Planet has taken the cake for <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/galleries/2010/04/best-of-green-2010-business-politics.php?page=10">Small Business of the Year</a>!

The work we do here is fairly diverse, so it's nice when somebody captures it succinctly.  TreeHugger's summary observed:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Offering credit and debit cards and carbon offsets, funding several small-scale renewable energy projects such as methane digesters and farmer-owned wind turbines, and also doing some interesting carbon reporting – most recently one on the <a href="http://attachments.brighterplanet.com/press_items/local_copies/52/original/carbon_foodprint_wp.pdf?1264533289">carbon footprint of food</a> which clarified some important aspects of the impact of food miles – Brighter Planet's products, projects and services stood out this year.“</p>

TreeHugger has just announced the “Best of Green” awards. And we’re proud and thrilled to see that Brighter Planet has taken the cake for [Small Business of the Year](http://www.treehugger.com/galleries/2010/04/best-of-green-2010-business-politics.php?page=10)!

The work we do here is fairly diverse, so it’s nice when somebody captures it succinctly. TreeHugger’s summary observed:

> "Offering credit and debit cards and carbon offsets, funding several small-scale renewable energy projects such as methane digesters and farmer-owned wind turbines, and also doing some interesting carbon reporting – most recently one on the [carbon footprint of food](http://attachments.brighterplanet.com/press_items/local_copies/52/original/carbon_foodprint_wp.pdf?1264533289)  which clarified some important aspects of the impact of food miles – Brighter Planet’s products, projects and services stood out this year."

Brighter Planet has been building technology for climate change since 2007, including a fully automated carbon offset provision, retirement, and assignment system (to interface with Bank of America and power our [credit and debit cards](http://brighterplanet.com/cards)) and what we feel is the world's best [carbon profiler](http://brighterplanet.com/users/me/footprint) for individuals.

We're opening up our technology as a platform, and we can't wait to see what can be done with these systems. Have a look at the [new site](http://brighterplanet.com) and tell us what you think.

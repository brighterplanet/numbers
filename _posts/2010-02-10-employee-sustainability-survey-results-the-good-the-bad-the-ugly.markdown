We've finally wrapped up the crunching, sifting, charting, and interpreting of the 30,000+ datapoints collected in our recent online survey about the employee engagement practices of US employers.  Thanks to all of you who took the time to respond to the <a href="http://attachments.brighterplanet.com/press_items/local_copies/57/original/ee_survey_questions.pdf?1265742090">survey questions</a>.  Today we released the report that details our findings.

Mindy Lubber, president of <a href="http://www.ceres.org/">Ceres</a> (and Brighter Planet advisory board member), signed onto the cause with her contribution of the foreword.  As she says, “This report from Brighter Planet both provides a benchmark for the status of employee sustainability programs in the US as they continue to evolve, and helps to inform their development by highlighting factors that contribute to their success. We look forward to watching employee engagement initiatives play an increasing role in helping our institutions to overcome the challenges of our time.”

Here are a few of the findings at a glance. <a href="http://brighterplanet.com/publications">Download the complete report</a> to get the full results and insights.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Most 	employers have only just begun interacting with employees around 	sustainability, and their efforts leave room for improvement. </strong>Although 86% of respondents said their organization promotes 	employee sustainability in some arena, only 16% said their employer 	collects data related to employee sustainability and just 14% said 	their employer had an official employee sustainability engagement 	policy.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Small 	organizations are leading on employee sustainability engagement.</strong> Organizations with fewer than 100 people are nearly twice as likely 	to promote sustainability very frequently, and their efforts are 	twice as likely to be effective at changing employee behavior. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>The 	most effective engagement programs feature an organization’s 	management or board as the main advocate for employee 	sustainability. </strong>These programs are three times as effective as 	those in which an employee sustainability director was the main 	advocate.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Employees 	are generally dissatisfied with their employers’ sustainability 	engagement efforts.</strong> Over 60% of respondents want to learn more 	about their employers’ and co-workers’ sustainability efforts, 	and 67% would like their employers to change their stance on 	sustainability. </span></span></span></li>
</ul>

We at Brighter Planet are extremely excited about our Carbon Middleware platform we [launched](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com/2010/08/13/announcing-carbon-middleware/) this year.  Carbon Middleware has continued to add climate intelligence to the constant stream of footprint and credit card data we process.  It's such a game-changing service that we think it's worthy of winning Tech Crunch's [2010 Crunchies Award](http://crunchies2010.techcrunch.com/).

The science behind our platform is unmatched.  The scientific models we use to calculate carbon emissions are [open source](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/science) and include [methodology statements](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/flights?origin_airport[iata_code]=JFK&destination_airport[iata_code]=SFO).  This means our platform offers a level of transparency and trust that no one else in the industry comes close to.  Furthermore, these models have been approved by third parties, such as [DMV](http://ineedalinktodmvhere.com).

Many carbon footprint analysis systems require a minimum set of data to work.  Carbon Middleware is flexible enough to work with any data available.  The more data available, the more precise our calculations are.  This means we can integrate with another system much more easily than others.

Our platform is "in the cloud," meaning that our customers don't have to worry about on-site installations and we can scale to meet growing demand.

From the beginning, our company's mission was to make managing your carbon footprint simple, whether you're an individual or an organization.  The more we know about and can mitigate our environmental impact, the faster we can work together to solve the climate crisis!

So what are you waiting for? [Nominate us now](http://crunchies2010.techcrunch.com/nominate/?MzE6QnJpZ2h0ZXIgUGxhbmV0) and tell your friends!

We at Brighter Planet are extremely excited about our Carbon Middleware platform that we [launched](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com/2010/08/13/announcing-carbon-middleware/) this year. We believe the platform is well positioned to change the way carbon information is gathered, viewed, and assessed. The challenge for any small company is getting eyeballs so others can see what you've been up to.

Tech Crunch's [2010 Crunchies Award](http://crunchies2010.techcrunch.com/) is an opportunity to help us do just that. So if you like what we've been working on please nominate us for best [CleanTech start-up of the year](http://crunchies2010.techcrunch.com/nominate/?MzE6QnJpZ2h0ZXIgUGxhbmV0).

If you're somewhat undecided, here are a few ways we're changing the game:

* **Carbon information on demand and integrated.** What if every time you wanted to know the caloric impact of your favorite snack you had to go to some third party to tell you. Chance are you probably wouldn't spend the time and you'd eat away calories be damned. At Brighter Planet, we think the problem with carbon information is it's too hard to find out about impact. We designed Carbon Middleware, so that you could learn about the carbon impact of your decisions contextually, whether that be when you're booking a flight on [kayak](http://www.careplane.org/), sending a package with [FedEx](yaktrak.org), or using some other online tool.
* **No more black box.** If you enter information into ten carbon calculators chance are you'll get ten different scores and have no idea why. We think this causes a trust problem. To combat it, Brighter Planet is embracing radical transparency. To begin our carbon models are open source. Then every calculation we provide, includes methodology documentation so you can see how we derived our estimate. And lastly, our models are being third party verified so you can be assured that we're not just making this up.
* **Less than a penny.** Carbon is so ubiquitous that if you have to pay a fortune to account for it, you'll probably break the bank long before you reduce your impact. With Carbon Middleware you pay a fraction of a cent per calculation. You don't have some large upfront fee or monthly hosting cost, you just pay for what you use.

While there are a lot of hurdles to confronting climate change, information accessability doesn't need to be one of them.

So what are you waiting for? [Nominate us now](http://crunchies2010.techcrunch.com/nominate/?MzE6QnJpZ2h0ZXIgUGxhbmV0) and tell your friends!

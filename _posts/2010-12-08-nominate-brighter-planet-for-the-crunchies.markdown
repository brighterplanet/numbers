We at Brighter Planet are extremely excited about our Carbon Middleware platform that we [launched](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com/2010/08/13/announcing-carbon-middleware/) this year. We believe the platform is well positioned to change the way carbon information is gathered, viewed, and assessed. The challenge for any small company is getting eyeballs so others can see what you've been up to.

Tech Crunch's [2010 Crunchies Award](http://crunchies2010.techcrunch.com/) is an opportunity to help us do just that. So if you like what we've been working on please nominate us for best [CleanTech start-up of the year](http://crunchies2010.techcrunch.com/nominate/?MzE6QnJpZ2h0ZXIgUGxhbmV0).

Here's a quick summary of how we feel we're changing the game:

* **Carbon information on demand and integrated.** What if every time you wanted to know the caloric impact of your favorite snack you had to go to some third party to tell you? Chances are, you probably wouldn't spend the time. At Brighter Planet, we think the problem with carbon information is that it's too hard to get. We designed Carbon Middleware so that you could learn about the carbon impact of your decisions contextually, whether that be when you're booking a flight on [Kayak](http://www.careplane.org/), sending a package with [FedEx](http://yaktrak.org), or charging a hotel room to your [credit card](http://greenback.me).
* **No more black box.** If you enter information into ten carbon calculators chance are you'll get ten different scores and have no idea why. We think this causes a trust problem. To combat it, Brighter Planet is embracing radical transparency. Our carbon models are open source. Every calculation we provide includes methodology documentation so you can see how we derived our estimate. Finally, our models are being third-party certified so that you can be assured we're not just making this up.
* **Less than a penny.** Carbon is so ubiquitous that if you have to pay a fortune to account for it, you'll probably break the bank long before you reduce your impact. With Carbon Middleware you pay a fraction of a cent per calculation. You don't have some large upfront fee or monthly hosting cost, you just pay for what you use.

There are already too many hurdles to confronting climate change. Information accessibility doesn't need to be one of them.

So what are you waiting for? [Nominate us now](http://crunchies2010.techcrunch.com/nominate/?MzE6QnJpZ2h0ZXIgUGxhbmV0) and please tell your friends!

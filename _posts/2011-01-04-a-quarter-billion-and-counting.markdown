As we crossed into the new year this past weekend, Brighter Planet's members also crossed another threshold -- collectively, you've now offset more than a quarter of a billion pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.

Together you've delivered crucial construction funding to twenty community renewable energy and sustainable forestry projects that have prevented and sequestered a total of 262,507,601 pounds of carbon dioxide, and counting.

This is the equivalent of every home in the US turning off all their lights for almost 4 full days, of 8.5 million cars being removed from the road for a day, or of preventing enough CO2 emissions to fill 5.2 billion party balloons -- two for every child on earth. 

Keep up the good work!

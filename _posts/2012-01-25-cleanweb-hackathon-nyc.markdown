We're back from the [Cleanweb Hackathon](http://cleanwebhack.com/hackathon/)! It was a great weekend of meeting entrepreneurs in the clean tech space, joining forces with some of New York's finest hackers, and hanging out at [NYU's Interactive Telecommunications](http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/) space. 

## Hacking

Andy, Seamus and I helped two teams write apps and help get others up and running with our [CM1](http://impact.brighterplanet.com) API and [public data](http://data.brighterplanet.com).

I helped prototype an app, [CleanGPA](http://cleangpa.com), which gives you a GPA-like score based on your home energy usage. We developed with Rails, and aside from a few hangups around OAuth, I was once again amazed at how fast you can build an app with tools like [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#readme), [formtastic](https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic#readme). I've also been thrilled with the ease and speed of using [faraday](https://github.com/technoweenie/faraday#readme) and [vcr](https://www.relishapp.com/myronmarston/vcr) as tools to build clients against RESTful APIs.

## Yoga & Juice

We also had the pleasure of sponsoring an hour-long yoga session. It was intense but energized me for the rest of the day. My abs are still a little sore!

After yoga, we enjoyed some cleansing juices from Liquiteria. I am a huge fan of ginger and these drinks really hit the spot.

## The Apps

The winning apps were [Econofy](http://beta.econofy.com/), an efficient appliance shopping guide and ,[NYCBldgs](http://nycbldgs.com/), a tool that highlights the best and worst-performing buildings in New York City. Econofy did a great job rating products on a five-point scale and helping to calculate money saved by projecting electricity costs. NYCBldgs put New York's public building energy usage data to good use. I was amazed that the city was opening up so much useful data like this. It really goes a long way in helping us "clean tech hackers" get the job done.

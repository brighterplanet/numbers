This just in: [Greensburg Wind Farm](http://brighterplanet.com/projects/19-greensburg-wind-farm), the Kansas project that makes up a major portion of our offset portfolio, has been named [Wind Project of the Year](http://brighterplanet.com/projects/19-greensburg-wind-farm) by Renewable Energy World.

The Excellence in Renewable Energy awards were granted in five categories -- including solar, geothermal, biomass, and hydro in addition to wind -- with judges considering "the innovative technology that was employed as well as the projects’ impact on the industry at large and on the communities in which they were installed."

We work hard to source top-quality projects that meet our rigorous [offset policy](http://brighterplanet.com/pdfs/terms/Brighter_Planet-Carbon_Offset_Policy.pdf), and it's great to see one of our projects getting this recognition from industry analysts. Kudos to our partner NativeEnergy, whose vision and execution were critical in getting the project built. And many thanks to all you Brighter Planet [cardholders](http://giving.bankofamerica.com/brighterplanet?cm_mmc=DEP-Affinity-_-brighterplanet-PAR-_-DA05LT005Y_partnersite_BrighterPlanet_ABE_Productlink-_-MyExpression) out there whose daily support is instrumental in making this and [other projects](http://brighterplanet.com/projects) a reality.

As President Obabma said in a speech last year, Greensburg is "a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community – how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay."

Last week, our friends at <a href="http://www.casefoundation.org/about/our-story">The Case Foundation</a> sat down with Brighter Planet's Robbie Adler to talk about the release of our new crowdsourcing technology platform <a href="http://wowcrowd.com/">Wowcrowd</a>:


**Josh:** Thanks again for speaking to us today Robbie. Just to clarify for all of those who might be a bit confused, what exactly<em>is</em>Wowcrowd?


**Robbie:** Wowcrowd is a social web application that gives organizations the tools to crowdsource the allocation of funds, which helps them engage their stakeholders and surface bright ideas.

The concept is simple. An organization with a Wowcrowd account earmarks a  pool of money for a particular mission, and then opens the process to  their users---their employees, members, customers, constituents, or the  general public. Individual users submit proposed ideas for how the  funding could be spent, and then all the users vote to decide which of  the proposals will get funded and be realized.

**Josh:** What are the benefits of challenges and contests like  the ones being run on Wowcrowd?

**Robbie:** A well-run crowdsourced program can provide  some very important benefits for an organization. It opens a slice of  the decision-making process to their stakeholders, which engages them as  active participants in the organization's mission rather than as  passive donors or members---and an engaged constituent base clearly  offers many advantages.

It can also be a strong PR tool, because as we've learned, contest  participants (including proposal submitters and voters) end up devoting  their own energy and effort to spreading the word in support of their  cause, effectively creating brand ambassadors for the organization.  Administered through an online tool like Wowcrowd, these programs can be  easily integrated with other social media channels to efficiently  promote the fund and the organization.

Of course, another big benefit is the crowdsourced ideas themselves. By tapping into the collective intelligence of their stakeholders, a  contest administrator can efficiently surface creative ideas that are  diverse and compelling---ideas they likely wouldn't have thought of  themselves.

Established in 1997 by Jean and Steve Case, the Case Foundation utilizes a citizen-centered approach to encourage civic engagement in the U.S. and around the Globe. The organization focuses on the “big-swing-for-the-fences ideas” with large potential for change to achieve their mission: “invest in people and ideas that can change the world.”  Recently they conducted the <a href="http://www.casefoundation.org/projects/giving-challenge" target="_blank">America’s Giving Challenge</a>, a one month competition to unite people around the issues they care about, increase awareness for the issues, and attract donors. The challenge was enormously successful, bringing in over 105,000 donations and raising $2.1 million for various nonprofit causes.

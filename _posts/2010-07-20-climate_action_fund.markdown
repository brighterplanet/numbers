In the latest chapter of our perennial partnership with <a href="file:///C:/Users/Spencer/Desktop/Brighter%20PLanet/350.org">350.org</a>, Brighter Planet will provide the technology and underwriting to make 350's crowdsourced <a href="http://www.350.org/funds">Project Funds for Climate  Action</a> a reality.

Last fall, 350.org organized what CNN called "the most widespread day of political action in the planet's history," inspiring more than 5,000 events in 181 countries as part of the International Day of Climate Action. They continue to push the issue of climate change to forefront, inspiring a much needed sense of urgency in the fight to prevent catastrophic global change. Their slogan for this year, “Get to Work,” encourages grassroots action around the world, challenging people to step up and be the drivers of change in their communities, forcing our leaders to take action. In conjunction with [1010global.org](http://www.1010global.org/), which has already signed close to 80,000 people since January in demanding a 10% annual reduction in carbon emissions, 350.org has put forth 10/10/10 as a global day of action.

Beginning today and leading up to the 10/10/10 Work Parties, 350.org will give out eight $1000 microgrants every month through their <a href="http://www.350.org/funds" target="_blank">350 Project Funds for Climate Action</a>, funding Work Party projects that raise awareness about climate change, promote renewable energy, and show clearly that progress is possible.

Like Brighter Planet's <a href="http://projectfund.brighterplanet.com/">Project Fund</a>, the 350 Project Funds for Climate Action will powered by our new <a href="http://wowcrowd.com/">wowcrowd</a> platform, and the contest structure will be similar. Anybody can submit project proposals, anybody can vote on their favorite ideas, and each month the project with the most votes will be awarded a grant. Project ideas range from organized tree plantings to retrofitting buildings with more efficient CFL’s to setting up bike repair workshops.

As part of our partnership with 350.org, we've donated this month's Project Fund grant money to the 350 Project Climate Action Fund. You can do your part as well---we encourage you to <a href="http://www.350.org/funds">cast your ballots</a> to help determine the winners, and to <a title="Climate Action Fund" href="http://www.350.org/funds" target="_blank">submit</a> your climate  project ideas to the fund.  And as 10/10/10 approaches, you can also participate in helping make 350 ppm a reality by joining a local Work Party or registering your own. With your help, thousands of communities will come together to make 10/10 the biggest day of practical action to cut carbon the world has ever seen.

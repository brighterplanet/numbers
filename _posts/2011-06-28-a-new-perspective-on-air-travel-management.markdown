These days more and more organizations are measuring the carbon impacts of employee air travel programs. That's a good thing. Unfortunately, most are using a simplistic approach that leaves one of their hands tied when it comes to managing those programs for reduced carbon impact. Correcting this business intelligence shortfall is the focus of our [latest research paper](http://brighterplanet.com/research), an in-depth modeling analysis of more than a decade of global airline industry data.

Huffington Post ran [an article on the report](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/28/green-airlines-carbon-efficiency_n_885553.html) today, and the paper should speak for itself, but among the highlights are:

* **Huge efficiency variation.** Fuel use per passenger per mile varies more than tenfold across the airline industry, a fact most carbon calculations ignore to their detriment in terms of reporting accuracy, and more importantly, in terms of carbon reduction opportunity.

* **New sustainability potential.** Case studies of more than 300,000 employee flights at two major global corporations show that choosing carbon-efficient itineraries on existing routes, without cutting flights or increasing costs, can slash emissions by as much as 40%.

* **Real-world airline rankings.** This study is far from the first to rank airlines on sustainability, but few predecessors have accounted for real-world passenger volumes, load factors, freight shares, aircraft efficiencies, seating configurations, and route characteristics to provide as accurate a rating. Ryanair leads the 20 largest airlines in the international market, followed by Singapore Airlines and Continental. In the U.S. domestic market, Continental comes first, followed by JetBlue and Frontier.

* **Revealing industry trends.** Air travel efficiency has improved 20% since 2000, preventing the equivalent of an entire year's worth of flights over that time, and saving airlines (and thus travelers) 33 billion dollars on jet fuel at a time both were struggling in an ailing economy.

We ran this analysis by turning our [CM1 flight model](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/models/flight) on itself to process databases covering more than 9 billion passengers on 130 million worldwide flights over 10 years. That should be sufficient to qualify as data-driven decision making.

As of Monday, we have performed more than 2,000,000 [cloud-based calculations](http://brighterplanet.com/services). After all, climate risk management is about numbers, and Brighter Planet is about delivering those numbers to you.

You can:

* use your existing systems and software
* reach out with XML to get results
* keep the results in your own database, alongside your own data, where it will do the most good
* get professional consultants to perform the integration, or use your own developers
* [start immediately](http://keys.brighterplanet.com) and ping our free tech support <support@brighterplanet.com> (9&ndash;5 EST) when you need help.

Every organization has to build its own business case for climate intelligence. To help, we have [demos](http://brighterplanet.com/demos), [whitepapers](http://brighterplanet.com/research), and real results&mdash;so far more than 2,000,000 of them.

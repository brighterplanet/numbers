We've been hosting our own blog for a couple of years now on a custom Wordpress installation, dealing from time to time with all the idiosyncracies of a PHP application. As part of the process of launching our developer ecosystem, we thought we'd take the opportunity to transition to a more convenient, reliable approach.

After looking at a gazillion options (seriously, where are the blogging platforms that support syntax highlighting out of the box?), we settled on [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), which we're already using for our [Developer Hub](http://brighterplanet.github.com). We're hosting this using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), so deploys are as simple as

{% highlight console %}
$ git push
{% endhighlight %}

Anyways, expect to see a greater focus on the technology behind Brighter Planet here on the new blog. Here we go!

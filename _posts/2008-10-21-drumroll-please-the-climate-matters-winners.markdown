<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">These four videos, chosen by our distinguished panel of judges, represent the best of over 100 submissions from all around the country. What we at Brighter Planet found striking about the process has been the diversity of content and perspective. It has been made evermore apparent to us that to frame climate change as a youth issue, an energy issue, an environmental issue, etc. is fundamentally flawed. These videos creatively define climate change as an overarching issue. Some paint a daunting and often terrifying picture, while others seek to provide hope and inspiration. What they make clear is that the challenge of tackling climate change is also an opportunity. They urge our next president to act forcefully for the betterment of not only our planet, but its people.</p>

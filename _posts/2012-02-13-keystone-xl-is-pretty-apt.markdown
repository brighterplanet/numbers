We're in the midst of [24 Hours to Stop Keystone XL](http://act.350.org/sign/kxl/), a day-long push by 35+ organizations to send half a million letters to Senators asking them to stop the pipeline. It's a worthy, urgent cause and we at Brighter Planet will all be [sending our letters](http://act.350.org/sign/kxl/) today.

Naturally we were tinkering with some of the numbers related to Keystone, and one question jumped out at us: Just how much CO2 emissions are represented by the oil in KXL at any given point in time?

Wikipedia [tells us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline#Keystone_XL) the radius and length of the two extensions that make up the "XL" part of Keystone. We plugged that into Wolfram Alpha to get a nice volume calculation:

Take that volume and plug it into CM1's [Fuel Purchase](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/models/fuel_purchase) impact model and we get:

**2.4 million tons CO2e**

XL is right. [Here's the methodology](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/fuel_purchases?fuel_type=crude&volume=804400000).

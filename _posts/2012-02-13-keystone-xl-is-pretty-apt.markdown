We're in the midst of [24 Hours to Stop Keystone XL](http://act.350.org/sign/kxl/), a day-long push by 35+ organizations to send half a million letters to Senators asking them to stop the pipeline. It's a worthy, urgent cause and we at Brighter Planet will all be [sending our letters](http://act.350.org/sign/kxl/) today.

Naturally we were tinkering with some of the numbers related to Keystone, and one question jumped out at us: Just how much CO2 emissions are represented by the oil in KXL at any given point in time?

<!-- more start -->

To get an answer we used [CM1](http://impact.brighterplanet.com)'s [Fuel Purchase](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/models/fuel_purchase) impact model, feeding in the total volume of the pipeline extensions[^fn], along with the type of oil (in this case, crude). The result:

**2.4 million tons CO2e**

That's the GHG emissions represented by the oil that would be inside KXL at any point in time. [Here's the methodology](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/fuel_purchases?fuel_type=crude&volume=804400000).

"XL" is right.

[^fn]: Wikipedia [tells us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline#Keystone_XL) the radius and length of the two extensions that make up the "XL" part of Keystone. We plugged that into Wolfram Alpha to get [the volume](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=pi+*+457^2+millimeters^2+*+1226+km).

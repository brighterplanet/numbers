Well folks, we've been waiting for this day for some time now... We'd like to announce the launch of our video contest - <a href="http://vimeo.com/climatematters">Climate Matters: Inspire Our Next President</a>. We've partnered with <a href="http://www.1sky.org">1Sky</a>, a climate change organization based in Washington DC, and <a href="http://www.vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>, a premier video-sharing website, to make sure our leaders know why climate change must be addressed by our next president. That's why we're calling on Americans (that's you!) to create a 30 or 60 second video to deliver a clear, creative and compelling message to our leaders to take bold action on climate change.

Now, our message to you... What are you waiting for? Grab yourself a camera, it doesn't have to be fancy, and ask yourself what message you want to deliver to our leaders <strong>right now</strong>. Serious or funny, amateur or professional, we're opening the political space for you to share that message. Upload your video on <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/climatematters">Vimeo's Climate Matters website</a>, and be sure to self-promote. The top ten videos will be chosen based on average views per day, so you can help your video get to the top! Winning videos will be broadcast to a central audience of over 50 million people nationwide and will be shown to our leaders in Washington.

Check out the contest's introductory video, you might see some familiar faces!

The technology infrastructure within which Brighter Planet's web services operate is full of incredible open source software, including Ruby, Rails, Nginx, Rack, Vagrant, and dozens of others. We've always tried to contribute back to the free software community: our [carbon models](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/models) are open source, and we maintain well over a dozen general-purpose [open source projects on GitHub](http://brighterplanet.github.com/projects.html).

Recently we decided we wanted to take a cue from EngineYard's [OSS Community Grant](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/mitchell-hashimoto-joins-engine-yard-oss-community-grant-program/) program and provide financial support to the developers of open source software packages that play an important role within our technology ecosystem or that make integration easier for our customers. We're now happy to announce the [Brighter Planet Developer Fellowship](http://brighterplanet.github.com/fellowship.html). There's a list of ideas at that link, along with application details and grant information. 

![Scott Bulua headshot](/images/scott.jpg){: style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" } We're thrilled to welcome our first Developer Fellow, [Scott Bulua](http://twitter.com/iamscott). Scott's building a plugin for [TripIt](http://tripit.com) that tracks the carbon footprints of users' itineraries using calculations powered by our [CM1 web service](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com). We'll be hearing from Scott on this blog from time to time as he develops his tool; check back for updates.

Interested? The Developer Fellowship accepts unsolicited applications, so visit [the Fellowship page](http://brighterplanet.github.com/fellowship.html) for details.

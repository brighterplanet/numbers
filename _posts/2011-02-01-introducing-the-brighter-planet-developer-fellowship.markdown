We use a whole lot of open source software at Brighter Planet---Ruby, Rails, and Vagrant, just to name a few. A few months ago, we decided that we wanted to take a cue from EngineYard's [OSS Community Grant](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/mitchell-hashimoto-joins-engine-yard-oss-community-grant-program/) program and provide meaningful financial support to the volunteer developers of important software projects.

We're now happy to announce the [**Brighter Planet Developer Fellowship**](http://brighterplanet.github.com/fellowship.html).

Calling all developers: Do you maintain software critical to the GitHub-EngineYard-AWS ecosystem? Working on a scientific library for Ruby? Have an idea for a clever way to use [CM1](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com) carbon calculations? Curate an authoritative dataset? We can support and accelerate your good work. Please get in touch (#brighterplanet on Freenode, [@brighterplanet](http://twitter.com/brighterplanet) on Twitter, or [brighterplanet](http://github.com/brighterplanet) on GitHub).   

![Scott Bulua headshot](/images/scott.jpg){: style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" } We're thrilled to welcome our first Developer Fellow, [Scott Bulua](http://twitter.com/iamscott). Scott's building a plugin for [TripIt](http://tripit.com) that tracks the carbon footprints of users' itineraries using calculations powered by our [CM1 web service](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com). We'll be hearing from Scott on this blog from time to time as he develops his tool; check back for updates.

Interested? The Developer Fellowship accepts unsolicited applications, so visit [the Fellowship page](http://brighterplanet.github.com/fellowship.html) for details.

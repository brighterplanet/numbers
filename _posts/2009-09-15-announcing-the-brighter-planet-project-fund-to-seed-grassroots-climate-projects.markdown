Over the past few years, we have been continually inspired by the thousands of individuals and community organizations growing the climate movement from the ground up. We’re thrilled to announce a new monthly micro-grant fund, the <strong><a href="http://brighterplanet.com/project_fund_projects">Brighter Planet Project Fund</a></strong>, to provide motivated Americans with seed money for projects that help people fight and adapt to climate change.

As you know we spend quite a bit of time here fussing with <strong>our</strong> projects—the wind turbines and methane digesters that produce the offsets you earn with our cards. But this fund is about <strong>your</strong> projects: the neighborhood-scale solutions like weatherization and education that might not produce offsets but are nevertheless critically important to the planet. Think of it like a grassroots stimulus package for the climate.

One of the things we're proudest of is that the fund is endowed by our members. Every time you use one of our cards or purchase an offset package from us, a percentage of our revenue gets deposited automatically into the fund. This means that as the Brighter Planet community grows, we'll be able to do more and more good.

Know a local school that could use some insulated windows? Maybe your church wants to put a solar panel on its roof? Want to invite a climate leader to speak at your library? You guys have the ideas; let's make them happen.

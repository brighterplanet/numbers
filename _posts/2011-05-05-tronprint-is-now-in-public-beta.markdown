Our [Tronprint plugin](http://addons.heroku.com/tronprint) for [Heroku](http://heroku.com), which [measures your cloud app's carbon footprint](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com/2011/03/02/tronprint-measure-the-footprint-of-your-cloud-application/), has just graduated from private beta to public beta! This means anyone with a Heroku account can try it out. Of course, if you don't use Heroku, you can still install the [Tronprint gem](http://brighterplanet.github.com/tronprint/) in your existing Ruby or Rails application.

We'd love to hear your feedback, so feel free to [tweet](http://twitter.com/brighterplanet) or [email](mailto:info@brighterplanet.com) us.

I'm getting word that Brighter Planet credit and debit cardholders have collectively blazed past yet another major milestone on the road to a cleaner future: 300,000,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions offset!

Three hundred million pounds. Sounds impressive, but how much prevented CO<sub>2</sub> is this, really? Well, it's equivalent to the carbon footprint of all the lights in every US home over more than four days -- or of more than eleven million Americans leaving their car in the garage for a day and instead riding their bicycle to work. This volume of CO<sub>2</sub> would fill a few party balloons for every child on earth -- or it would fill one tractor trailer, every single day, for 1800 years.

An impressive accomplishment indeed. But what's equally impressive is how it's been accomplished: through the widespread use of innovative technology and market mechanisms that harness the power of everyday actions to build (quite literally) a clean energy future.

Thank you, all you Brighter Planet members, for doing your part.

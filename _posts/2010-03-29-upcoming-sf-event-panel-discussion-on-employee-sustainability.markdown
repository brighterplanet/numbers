We're pleased to announce that Brighter Planet is partnering with [San Francisco Carbon Collaborative](http://www.carboncollaborative.org/)  to host a lively event in our newest home, San Francisco!  If you're on the west coast, come join us on Wednesday, April 14 for a high-level panel discussion that will examine findings from our recently published report on employee engagement in corporate sustainability.  We'll hand the conversation to our panelists, who will share their experiences, strategies, and best practices in an interactive forum.  It will be a great opportunity to learn from companies who are leading the charge in incorporating employees (and their ideas!) into a sustainability strategy.  And yes, there will be [drink](http://www.climatini.org/about/).  Hope you can make it!  See the details below...

Employee Engagement is becoming an increasingly popular means to drive corporate sustainability efforts.  Around the world, companies and communities are mobilizing their workforces to lessen pollution, waste and operational inefficiencies.  However, a new analysis by Brighter Planet suggests that employees are generally dissatisfied with their employers’ sustainability initiatives.  Moreover, many employers are unable to quantify the effects of their internal efforts.  This finding is especially timely in light of increasing executive pressure to measure the impact of sustainability work on bottom line.

Please join the <a href="http://www.carboncollaborative.org/">San Francisco Carbon Collaborative</a>, <a href="http://brighterplanet.com/about">Brighter Planet</a>, and <a href="http://www.climatini.org/">Climatini </a>on April 14th, for a panel discussion and an exploration of how to better foster Employee Engagement in the sustainability arena.  We’ll preview the new Brighter Planet study and consider the following:

* How can companies enhance CSR strategies by fusing employee initiative and forward green thinking?
* How does the strategy of sustainable employee engagement ft within the larger theme of CSR?
* How can we measure CSR/EE impacts upon triple bottom lines?
* What are the pros and cons of implementing top-down vs. bottom-up sustainability programs?
* How should companies incentivize employee-led initiatives?
* Where are the cutting-edge opportunities and best-practice ideas?

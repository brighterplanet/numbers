Today is a big day in Greensburg, Kansas. This morning is the official groundbreaking on the <a href="http://brighterplanet.com/projects/19-greensburg-wind-farm">Greensburg Wind Farm</a> by <em>Native</em>Energy, the most recent offset project funded by Brighter Planet members. The project has been years in the planning, but with construction beginning today the ten 1.25 Mw turbines are set to be operational by this coming spring. They’ll generate enough clean electricity to power the 4,000 homes in the community several times over, and prevent the release of more than a billion pounds of CO2 over twenty years.

Brighter Planet is excited to stand by other charter supporters in making this project a reality, including Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Clif Bar, Stonyfield Farm, and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. And we’re also excited to give individuals the opportunity to invest in this project through both and creative channels, like [applying their credit card reward points](http://brighterplanet.com/products) to help bring the project to life.

Discovery Chanel’s Planet Green is set to film the groundbreaking, as they have many other events in their [inspiring series](http://planetgreen.discovery.com/tv/greensburg/) chronicling the rebuilding of Greensburg from tornado disaster zone to model green town. We’ll share that video here as soon as it becomes available.

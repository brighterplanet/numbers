We at Brighter Planet had a great idea for the DOE's Apps for Energy challenge. There's a new standard the DOE is championing called "[Green Button](http://greenbuttondata.org)" which would allow anyone to download their energy usage data from their utility. With this data, there are many ways apps could help us save energy.

Some utilities, like PG&E, have stepped up, joined Green Button, and allowed people to download their data. However, there is a problem. For smart energy apps to work well, they have to be able to get our Green Button data without us having to log in and download the data every month/hour/minute. That's where our app, Sparkwire, comes in!

Sparkwire allows you to connect any app to your data. You just provide Sparkwire with your utility site login and it does the rest. Don't worry, your login info is encrypted and can only be used when an app you authorize requests access. [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSxuSUip_OA) demonstrates everything.

Please help us out by voting at [challenge.gov](http://appsforenergy.challenge.gov/submissions/7984-sparkwire). You can vote once per day. Thank you!

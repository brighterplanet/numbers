With PR, federal grants, and car sales increasingly hinging on fuel economy, auto manufacturers are vying for the spotlight on green vehicle technology. But underneath all the noise, how do the numbers really stack up? What's the most fuel-efficient car company, and how do you even decide?

One way is to find the most efficient vehicle offered for sale. For model year 2011 that's either the electric-only Nissan Leaf with 87.9 miles per gas gallon equivalent, or the plugin hybrid Chevy Volt with 93 mpge running on electricity and 37 mpg running on gasoline. Running on electricity both far outstrip the best gas-only car, the Toyota Prius, which gets 49.3 mpg. But what about Nissan and Chevy's other vehicles?

Another way to look at manufacturer fuel economy is to average across all of a manufacturer's vehicles, weighted by sales. This is how the U.S. government calculates fuel economy for the CAFE program, and the latest (model year 2010) data shows Kia at the top with 35.3 mpg. Toyota places 3rd with 34.1 mpg, Nissan comes in 9th with 30.8 mpg, and Chevy's parent GM places 12th with 27.8 mpg.[^1]

Sales-weighted fuel economy tells you how efficient the average car people are buying is, but it doesn't show which manufacturers focus on fuel efficiency across their entire vehicle line. So we took an unweighted average across all 2011 models for each manufacturer. This gives a sense of the vehicles each manufacturer offers for sale - whether most are efficient or if they mainly design gas-guzzlers.

The winner by this measure is Mini, with an average of 30 mpg.[^2] Nissan comes in 4th with 25.3 mpg, Kia comes in 7th with 25.1 mpg, Toyota places 11th with 23.8 mpg, and Chevy is 28th with 19.6 mpg.

Mini's focus on small, efficient cars makes them the manufacturer most committed to fuel efficiency across their vehicle portfolio. Also deserving of mention is the runner-up, Honda, whose average of 27.4 mpg makes them the most fuel-efficiency focused manufacturer that offers trucks and SUVs. Their vehicles may not be at the cutting edge of efficiency, but they quietly perform across the board.

And for comparison, here's a chart showing all automobile manufacturers.

[^1]: These values are not comparable to the other fuel economies given here because the CAFE program uses unweighted fuel economy ratings. All other fuel economies given here use the EPA's adjusted fuel economy ratings, which more accurately reflect real-world performance.
[^2]: Mini may also lead in sales-weighted fuel economy, but the CAFE program doesn't disaggregate Mini from their parent company, BMW.

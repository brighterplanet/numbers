The idea is simple--share your own experiences reducing your “foodprint,” learn how others are making great food that’s also good for the planet, and win some killer prizes!

These days, it’s hard to miss the hubub about electric cars and fluorescent lights, wind turbines and cash for clunkers.  But it might come as a surprise to learn that in terms of carbon emissions, the impact of the food you eat is on par with the car you drive and the home you inhabit.  This <a href="http://blog.brighterplanet.com/sustainable-cooking/">contest </a>is all about raising that awareness, sharing great ways we can each reduce the climate impact of our diets.

Here’s how it works.  Just browse through the <a href="../sustainable-cooking/tips-to-choose-from/">cooking conservation tips</a>, and submit stories and photos of how you reduce your impact for each category you're interested in.  As you’re poking around, be sure to give a nod to other experiences you like—at the end of the contest, stories with the most "thumbs up" will be rated against the <a href="../sustainable-cooking/judging-criteria/">judging criteria</a>.

Culinary and conservation heavyweights on our <a href="../sustainable-cooking/judges/">judging panel</a> include chef and local food pioneer Alice Waters, author and journalist Bill McKibben, and Stonyfield Farms CEO Gary Hirshberg.

Yes, <a href="../sustainable-cooking/prizes/">there is loot to be won</a>: random prizes throughout the contest, and top prizes of Amazon Kindle DXs in each category.  The top experiences will be published online, and broadcast here on our blog.  And just as importantly, you’ll learn about ways make delicious, low-impact meals, and inspire others to do the same!

Join us at the <a href="http://blog.brighterplanet.com/sustainable-cooking/">main contest page</a>!

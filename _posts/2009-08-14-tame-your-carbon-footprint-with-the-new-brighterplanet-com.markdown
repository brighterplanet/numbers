We turned on our new website for real this week. <em>w00t! WAHOO!! YEE-HAWW!!!</em> (Beg pardon — that little celebration has been more than a year in coming.)

The new <a href="http://brighterplanet.com">brighterplanet.com</a> is a free, fun, and easy-to-use web utility that will help you succeed in living a more planet-friendly lifestyle, in the same way that other online tools help people get a handle on their finances or adopt a diet/fitness regimen. All you need to get rolling is a desire to be part of the solution to environmental challenges. We'll show you — and help you show others — how personal choices add up, how to get started, and where to pick off low-hanging fruit.

Feedback from early-bird users was immensely helpful in refining the app through our beta period. And (now that we've danced our little jig, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBmyNHiMvR4">kinda like these guys</a>), it's back to work. We'll  continue to shape brighterplanet.com based on your feedback, and we're not planning to rest for a long while. There's lots to do:
<ul>
	<li><em>Twitter integration.</em> Soon you'll be able to link your twitter account to your Brighter Planet profile.  This will give you easy access to sharing your experience with your friends.</li>
	<li><em>Facebook integration.</em> Facebook connect is coming soon.  You'll be able to interact with your facebook friends right from the Brighter Planet website.</li>
	<li><em>Widgets and badges</em> that can be embedded virtually anywhere.</li>
	<li><em>Share your Brighter Planet activity anywhere via a custom RSS feed.</em></li>
	<li><em>Carbon profiler precision:</em> soon you'll be able to tell us how much waste you generate, and how much of it is recycled.  You'll also be able to calculate your pet's emissions!</li>
	<li><em>Carbon profiler UX enhancements:</em> we're constantly working on new ways to make entering information easier.</li>
	<li><em>Compare your footprint</em> to others on Brighter Planet.</li>
	<li><em>More third-party integration.</em> We're all set to start doing data handshakes with some of the big get-things-done services (spots where you pay your bills, do some shopping, make travel plans, etc).</li>
	<li><em>Historical data / visualizations.</em> Set conservation goals and track your progress over time.</li>
</ul>
What's missing from this list?  What new feature (or change to an existing one) would make you the most excited?

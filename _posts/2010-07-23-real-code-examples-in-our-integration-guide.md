I realize that not everybody uses Ruby/Rails, so integration with our [emission estimate web service](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com) won't always be facilitated by [our sharp little carbon gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/carbon).

Still, if I were a third-party developer, there is nothing I would want more than unfiltered code examples from a real integration, no matter the language.

Therefore I present our [unfinished integration guide](http://github.com/brighterplanet/carbon/blob/master/doc/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.rdoc), complete with real diffs.

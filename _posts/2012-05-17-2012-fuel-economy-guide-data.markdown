Another data update - you can now find the fuel economy and other info for all 2012 model-year automobiles sold in the US in our [public data repository](http://data.brighterplanet.com).

This data release took unusually long to process because we decided to improve the way we handle dual-fuel and alternate fuel vehicles in light of their increasing popularity. We now store all EPA-reported fuel efficiencies for every vehicle. Using the [Automobile](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/models/automobile) or [Automobile Trip](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/models/automobile_trip) impact models on [Cm1](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/) you can specify a particular fuel with the 'automobile fuel' characteristic.

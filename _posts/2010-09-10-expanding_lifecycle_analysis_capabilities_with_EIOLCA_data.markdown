We're pleased to announce that we've just added the [Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIOLCA)](http://www.eiolca.net/) model to our carbon data resources. Licensing this authoritative model further expands our ability to perform lifecycle and supply chain carbon emissions analysis.

The carbon accounting field is increasingly focusing on Scope 3 emissions, including supply chain and product lifecyle emissions. Supplier sustainability programs by institutions like [Walmart](http://walmartstores.com/sustainability/9292.aspx), [IBM](http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/27174.wss), [P&G](http://www.pgsupplier.com/environmental-sustainability-scorecard), and the [federal government](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-signs-an-Executive-Order-Focused-on-Federal-Leadership-in-Environmental-Energy-and-Economic-Performance) are driven by the realization that for many organizations, embodied emissions represent the majority of total carbon impact.

The EIOLCA model from Carnegie Melon University's [Green Design Institute](http://gdi.ce.cmu.edu/) combines federal [Economic Census](http://www.census.gov/econ/census07/) data with research on the environmental impacts of hundreds of economic sectors. It enables lifecycle assessment for all phases of production including raw materials extraction, transport, manufacturing, and retail.

Through our new partnership with CMU, Brighter Planet will provide rapid environmental impact analysis for goods and services such as electronics, food, healthcare, vehicles, consulting, entertainment, clothing, and supplies.

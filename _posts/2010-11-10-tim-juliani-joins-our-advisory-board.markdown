We're excited to announce that Tim Juliani, Director of Corporate Engagement at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, has joined our [Advisory Board](http://brighterplanet.com/about/people#advisors). We first met Tim in the summer of 2008, when he stopped by our Middlebury office to discuss carbon offsets.

Tim brings years of experience working at the crossroads of business and the environment. Amongst many of his roles, he directs the Pew Center's Business Environmental Leadership Council, (BELC) the largest US-based association of companies devoted to climate related policy and corporate strategies. His perspective and insight will help the development and growth of Carbon Middleware.

Welcome Tim!

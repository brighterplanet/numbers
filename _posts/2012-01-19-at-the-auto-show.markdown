January is an exciting month for us. Each year the EPA updates its fuel economy guide with the year's newest models. As soon as they're available we send our data mining robots (the artificial brains behind [our data service](http://data.brighterplanet.com)) to fetch, clean, and store the data for use in our automobile-related impact calculators. This year, I swung by the North American International Auto Show to see in person what this year's new cars are bringing to the table. There are quite a few interesting things!

The major theme with regards to sustainability was that nearly every auto maker offers some sort of hybrid, electric, or diesel-powered car. It seems like not very long ago there were only a few companies offering hybrids and many alternative fuel cars were merely concepts. Even Dodge, not normally known for fuel efficiency, boasted of the new Dart offering improved fuel economy with its turbocharged engine.

I am a geek and one of the neat parts about the auto show is the way the auto makers display their technology. A few companies displayed the inner workings of their electric drivetrains and batteries. It's very eye-opening to see how many batteries they can stuff into the cars and how may batteries are required just to propel a 2,000lb car at speeds we're accustomed to. It was also fun to listen to visitors from the auto industry examine and critique the construction of the Tesla drivetrain. It reminded me of all the time I've spent evaluating and choosing open source software projects on Github.

Electric vehicles were certainly a dominant theme at the show. One company really intrigued me, [VIA](http://www.viamotors.com/), which converts GM trucks and vans into electric vehicles that operate similarly to the Volt. A unique benefit of essentially converting a utility truck into a mobile generator is that you can plug any of your electric tools into an outlet connected to the engine. This sort of conversion could really benefit companies looking to reduce emissions and/or save on fuel costs. Since these are OEM conversions, they will appear in next year's EPA fuel economy guide, which means they'll show up in our database, too!

Many of the luxury brands are firmly placed the fuel efficiency scene. BMW will soon introduce hybrids and electric vehicles, Mercedes is emphasizing its diesel engines, and Lexus has its collection of hybrids. It seems that fuel economy is factoring into more than just the low and mid-range markets.

There is still only one maker selling natural gas-powered cars in the US - Honda with its Civic GX. Even though CNG's cost of 6 cents per mile is below that of gasoline (roughly equivalent to $1.50/gallon), it's still above the Nissan Leaf's 3.5 cents per mile cost while still suffering the same "range anxiety" issues. I could imagine, however, seeing existing gasoline cars converted to natural gas given our current glut of gas in the US. This was actually done in Europe during World War II! It would also be interesting to compare the efficiency of burning the gas directly in an internal combustion engine versus charging a battery with electricity generated from natural gas.

With all of the improved gas-burning cars and flashy new (and expensive) "battery-guzzling" electric cars, I was surprised to see something you'd never expect to see at an auto show - bicycles, scooters, and personal rapid transit cabs. Since these smaller vehicles only need a battery a tenth of the size of an electric car (or smaller), these could end up being a more practical solution for many.

Overall, smaller, more efficient vehicles seems to be the dominant theme as the future unfolds. There were still plenty of powerful, sporty cars and trucks, but even these are seeing efficiency improvements. My hope is that a combination of these efficiencies and a return to

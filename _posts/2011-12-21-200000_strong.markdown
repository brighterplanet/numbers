As of today, Brighter Planet’s 200,000+ customers have offset more than 285,000,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. By simply using your Brighter Planet credit and debit cards in your daily lives, you’ve helped fund 20 renewable energy and sustainable forestry [projects](http://brighterplanet.com/projects), bringing green jobs to rural America, proving the viability of community-scale clean technologies, and preventing nearly two weeks worth of GHG, SO<sub>2</sub>, mercury, and particulate pollution from a typical coal-fired power plant.

The CO<sub>2</sub> you’ve collectively prevented is equivalent to:

- Every home in the US shutting off all its lights for more than 4 days
- The emissions sequestered by 33 million tree saplings in a year
- More than 10 million people biking to work for a day instead of driving
- Each of our 200,000+ cardholders powering their homes with renewable energy for 3 weeks
- Grounding all air travel to and from NYC for more than 5 days

Keep up the good work!

<img src="http://static.brighterplanet.com/creative/campaigns/earthtweet/site/images/badge.png" align="left" style="padding: 10px;"> We just launched <a href="http://earthtweet.com">#earthtweet</a>, a campaign to raise awareness of the fight against climate change in the days leading up to Earth Day (April 22) -- and beyond.

Here's the idea: #earthtweet uses Twitter -- the booming social network of the moment -- to bring together tips, news, information about events, and anything else that's relevant to solving our climate problem. (Yeah, most of us here at Brighter Planet have caught the Twitter bug -- it's the most useful, vibrant, and fun social network we've seen to date.)

If you're already on Twitter, all you have to do is tell us what you are doing -- today -- for the planet. Just make sure to use the tag #earthtweet somewhere in each item you're sharing on Twitter, so everyone else can find it. We'll also be giving away some eco-friendly prizes throughout the campaign, so follow <a href="http://twitter.com/earthtweet">@earthtweet</a> to stay posted.

If you're not yet among the converted, this is a perfect opportunity to give Twitter a try. Twitter is like CB radio, but for text messaging -- it's a great way to stay connected to friends, family, and as many other people as you like. <a href="http://twitter.com">Sign up</a> and then you can "follow" <a href="http://twitter.com/earthtweet">@earthtweet</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/brighterplanet">@brighterplanet</a>!

In the last few months we've seen people achieve amazing things through collective effort on Twitter. Some examples:

* Two months ago, a group called [charity: water](http://www.charitywater.org/) issued through Twitter a call for help raising awareness and funds to bring clean drinking water to some of the poorest people in the world. The twitter community responded, [organizing fundraisers in more than 200 cities around the world](http://www.twestival.com/) and raising a quarter million dollars for the cause.
* Last Christmas, a TVA coal-burning power plant spilled millions of gallons of toxic coal ash into an East Tennessee river. Advocates on the ground -- with support from Twitter folks all over the country -- used Twitter to report on the immense scale of the disaster. [The buzz grew loud enough that the sluggish national media finally began to cover the story](http://www.mnn.com/technology/computers/stories/media-mayhem-can-twitter-save-the-earth); since then, the Obama administration has made clean-up of thousands of dangerous coal-ash ponds all over the nation part of its agenda.
* PowerShift09 organizers and attendees [used Twitter to serve notice that young people are energized and out in force](http://powershift09.org/node/894), working to drive the nation toward a clean energy economy.


Well, we want some of that action! We really hope that #earthtweet can make some noise about doing one's part to solve the climate problem. It's really up to all of you -- #earthtweet will go exactly as far as you take it.

Have a ball with it. You'll find badges, a widget, and temporary Twitter avatars available at <a href="http://earthtweet.com">http://earthtweet.com</a>.

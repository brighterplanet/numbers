title: New Year, New Offset Policy

As we kick off 2009, we'd like to introduce you to our new carbon offset policy. As with most new models, you'll find that little has changed from our <a href="http://brighterplanet.com/policy">current PANTS policy</a>. But the start of a new year, our second since launching, seemed a good time to pause, reflect, and distill our experience into an update of what constitutes a quality carbon offset.

The result of that process is RATE:

<strong>Real</strong>
Real offsets are permanent emissions reductions that are properly quantified, audited, and retired. Brighter Planet offsets cannot be invalidated by future events, are tracked and accounted for, and are not double-sold or double-counted.

<strong>Additional</strong>
A project that is additional would not have been built were it not for the prospect of receiving proceeds from the sale of offsets. Brighter Planet will not invest in projects that would have occurred anyway, as they produce no extra reduction in emissions and therefore do not produce bona fide carbon offsets.

<strong>Transparent</strong>
Complete transparency throughout the offset lifecycle is essential, given the inherent intangibility of carbon offsets and the absence of regulation in the voluntary market. Brighter Planet's process includes a public comment period for projects under consideration, disclosure of our Project Selection Committee's decisions, posting of project documents online, and an annual audit of sales and retirements.

<strong>Environmental and Social Value Added</strong>
Projects with environmental and social value added fight climate change while also helping solve other pressing challenges facing our communities and ecosystems. Brighter Planet invests in community-based climate solutions that also address issues like public health, biodiversity, poverty, and water quality.

RATE is what our <a href="http://brighterplanet.com/groups/4">Project Selection Committee</a> will use to evaluate new offset projects being considered for inclusion in our portfolio. We like it, but we also want to know what you think. Please let us know by commenting below.

Thanks!

As you’ll see below, the core aspects of our carbon offset policy remain unchanged. Our goal with RATE was to refine what we consider to be the most important aspects of offset quality and express these more concisely.

<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="50%"><strong>Permanence</strong>
Offsets must be permanent so that carbon reductions are not invalidated by some unforeseen problem. Source-side improvements such as wind farms, solar installations, and farm methane projects are built to provide carbon-free electricity for decades. On the other hand, offsets generated through sink-side improvements (such as tree planting) are theoretically attractive yet problematic in execution. The academic literature remains undecided on an appropriate measurement and monitoring strategy, so precise quantification of environmental benefit remains elusive. This is further complicated by an inability to predict natural disasters (such as forest fires) and prevent other disruptive events (timber harvesting, for example) that could compromise the environmental benefit represented by the offsets. By investing in source-side renewable energy projects, Brighter Planet will ensure that the environmental benefits we purchase will be as permanent as current technology allows.</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="50%"><strong>Real</strong>
Real offsets are permanent emissions reductions that are properly quantified, audited, and retired. Brighter Planet offsets cannot be invalidated by future events, are tracked and accounted for, and are not double-sold or double-counted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">We changed from ‘Permanent’ to ‘Real’ to emphasize the importance of offset verification and reflect the growing sophistication of industry standards. Many standards use buffers or other insurance mechanisms to ensure that offsets from forest carbon sequestration will not be invalidated by forest fires or other disruptive events.

<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="50%"><strong>Additional</strong>
The most important criterion is that projects are additional—that is, they would not have been built were it not for the prospect of receiving additional proceeds from the sale of offsets. “Business as usual” improvements, on the other hand, are non-additional and their corresponding pollution reduction cannot be sold as a bona fide offset. Brighter Planet will purchase offsets only from additional projects.</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="50%"><strong>Additional</strong>
A project that is additional would not have been built were it not for the prospect of receiving proceeds from the sale of offsets. Brighter Planet will not invest in projects that would have occurred anyway, as they produce no extra reduction in emissions and therefore do not produce bona fide carbon offsets.</td>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">We tweaked the wording for ‘Additional’ to make it a little clearer.
<hr /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="50%"><strong>New construction</strong>
Newly constructed projects result in measurable environmental benefit that can be directly attributed to customers. Some existing renewable energy projects were constructed without the pre-sale of their lifetimes’ worth of carbon offsets. These projects are able to sell so-called “current year” offsets year by year that represent dirty energy displacement at the time of generation and sale. As a corollary to the additionality requirement, Brighter Planet will prioritize offsets from new project construction over offsets from existing projects. Although these “current year” projects do help to stimulate the renewable energy movement, Brighter Planet focuses its investment in projects that would not be built without its offset purchase commitment. This will result in measurable additional environmental benefit that can be directly attributed to Brighter Planet customers.</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="50%"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">We cut 'New construction' because we decided it did not add to our assessment of project quality. The 'Real' and 'Additional' requirements ensure that offsets are measurable and would not otherwise have occurred. Offsets from new projects and recently constructed projects each have their own merits, and neither are categorically superior.
<hr /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="50%"><strong>Transparency</strong>
In the absence of trusted standards, transparency is the only guarantee of performance. Because a widely trusted “Good Housekeeping seal” for carbon offsets has yet to emerge, Brighter Planet will fill that role for its members. In order to ensure integrity, Brighter Planet purchases offsets only from suppliers that—like itself—subject themselves to annual auditing.</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="50%"><strong>Transparent</strong>
Complete transparency throughout the offset lifecycle is essential, given the inherent intangibility of carbon offsets and the absence of regulation in the voluntary market. Brighter Planet's process includes a public comment period for projects under consideration, disclosure of Project Selection Committee decisions, posting of project documents online, and an annual audit of sales and retirements.</td>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">We updated 'Transparency' to reflect the emergence of several trusted standards and give more details on Brighter Planet's processes.

<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="50%"><strong>Social value added</strong>
Investments with social value added improve well-being in local economies. The evolution toward a new renewable-energy infrastructure presents economic opportunities on both national and local levels. Brighter Planet gives priority to projects constructed using local labor and materials.</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="50%"><strong>Environmental and social value added</strong>
Projects with environmental and social value added fight climate change while also helping solve other pressing challenges facing our communities and ecosystems. Brighter Planet invests in community-based climate solutions that also address issues like public health, biodiversity, poverty, and water quality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">We changed 'Social value added' to 'Environmental and social value added' to emphasize that we select projects that have ancillary environmental benefits as well as climate change and social benefits.</td>

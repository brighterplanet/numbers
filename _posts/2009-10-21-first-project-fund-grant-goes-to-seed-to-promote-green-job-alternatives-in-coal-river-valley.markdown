We're pleased to announce that Andrew Munn from Rock Creek, West Virginia is the first recipient of a <a href="http://brighterplanet.com/project_fund_projects">Project Fund</a> grant. His project, <a href="http://brighterplanet.com/project_fund_projects/17">Sustainable Energy and Economic Diversification (SEED) in the Coal River Valley</a>, will receive $5,000 to get a kick-start on fighting climate change. With the support of Coal River Mountain Watch, SEED will reduce local dependency on coal extraction and help educate young students and workers on alternative forms of employment. Over two weeks, the project garnered a whopping total of 4,731 votes.

The October voting period showcased eighteen project proposals and brought in a total of 13,983 votes from across the country. Other top project submissions included an effort from Green Light New Orleans to install CFL light bulbs in low and middle income communities, and a project from the Burlington Food Council in Vermont to fund a staff position to promote local food networks.

This is just the first step in Brighter Planet's grassroots stimulus package for the climate. Six new grassroots submissions from California, Texas, West Virginia, Indiana, and New Hampshire have already been vetted and are on deck. Voting will begin again on November 1<sup>st</sup>, so be sure to come back and make your voice count!

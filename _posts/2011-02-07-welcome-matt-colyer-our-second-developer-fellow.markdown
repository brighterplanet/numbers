![Matt Colyer headshot](/images/matt.jpg){: style="float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" } Close on the heels of our [first fellow](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com/2011/02/01/introducing-the-brighter-planet-developer-fellowship), we're now super happy to welcome our second, Matt Colyer. We're huge fans of his [smartermeter](https://github.com/mcolyer/smartermeter) project and definitely want to see more like it for other energy providers. smartermeter's roadmap includes carbon calculation (powered by our [CM1](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com) service) and a UI for PG&amp;E customers.

Are you working on a project like Matt's? Or have another idea you want to pursue? The Developer Fellowship accepts unsolicited applications, so visit [the Fellowship page](http://brighterplanet.github.com/fellowship.html) for details.

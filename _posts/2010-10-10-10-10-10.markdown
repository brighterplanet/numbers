Just got back from my [10/10/10 work event](http://www.350.org/node/18302): canvassing North Cambridge with free CFLs to give residents in exchange for their incandescents.

Now i'm watching reports [streaming in](http://twitter.com/search/#101010) from around the world and following the [blog](http://www.350.org) for some highlights. I was especially proud to see one of our [Project Fund grant recipients](http://projectfund.brighterplanet.com/projects/roots_of_change_cooperativa) listed as a featured U.S. project by the 350 staff.

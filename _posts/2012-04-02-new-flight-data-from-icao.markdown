We've just incorporated the latest ICAO flight stage data into our [flight carbon and energy model](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/models/flight). The update includes data for international flights in 2009, 2010, and 2011 and adds several new airlines, such as Air Bucharest, Mihin Lanka, and UTair-Ukraine. It also adds some new direct routes such as [Accra to Algier](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/flights?segments_per_trip=1&origin_airport=acc&destination_airport=alg), [Malaga to Moscow](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/flights?segments_per_trip=1&origin_airport=agp&destination_airport=dmv), and [Zurich to Yerevan](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/flights?segments_per_trip=1&origin_airport=zrh&destination_airport=evn).

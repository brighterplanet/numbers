Every year we do a holiday card for our friends (remember [last year's](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com/2010/12/16/reindeer-holiday-carbon-and-the-cloud/)?) that connects the work we do to some aspect of the season. Click the image to check out this year's card:

There's some fancy new technology under the hood (more on that <del>in a later blog post</del> [here](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com/2011/12/19/building-snowflakes-the-tech-behind-our-holiday-card)), so you'll need a new-ish browser.

Wishing you all the best in 2012,
Patti and the team

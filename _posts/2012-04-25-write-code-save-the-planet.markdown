We're happy to announce [greendreams](http://greendrea.ms), a compendium of environmental APIs for all the Cleanweb hackers out there.

Currently we have 6 APIs listed, but of course the more the merrier, so please [fork away](https://github.com/brighterplanet/greendreams) and add your favorites. Big thanks go out to Genability, GoodGuide, NREL, EPA, and AMEE for helping out with the first crop of APIs.

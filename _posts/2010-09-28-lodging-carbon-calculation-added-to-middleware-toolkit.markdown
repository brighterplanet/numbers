Following up on our [recent release](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com/2010/09/22/event-carbon-calculation-added-to-middleware-toolkit/) of an event module for our carbon middleware service, we're excited to announce the release of a [lodging module](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/lodgings).

The lodging module lets software developers calculate emissions from hotel energy use within their own applications by specifying a range of [characteristics](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/lodgings/options) through our [API](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/).

The calculations are based on the EIA's [Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey](http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/) and the EPA's [eGRID](http://www.epa.gov/egrid/) dataset, both of which are imported automatically to our system on a daily basis to ensure currency.

Possible applications of the lodging emitter include a company calculating scope 3 emissions from business travel, a hotel booking website calculating your stay's emissions, a travel agent adding offsets for lodging emissions to a vacation package... but don't let us limit your thinking!

We're hard at work cranking out more emitters, so stay tuned for updates.

Following up on our [recent release](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com/2010/09/22/event-carbon-calculation-added-to-middleware-toolkit/) of an event module for our carbon middleware service, we're excited to announce the release of a [lodging module](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/lodgings/options).

Developers can now use our [API](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/) to calculate emissions from hotel energy use within their own applications. The calculations use data from the EIA's [Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey](http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cbecs/) and the EPA's [eGRID](http://www.epa.gov/egrid/), which are automatically imported to our [database](http://data.brighterplanet.com/) and updated nightly to ensure currency.

Possible applications of the lodging emitter include a company calculating Scope 3 emissions from business travel, a hotel booking website calculating your stay's emissions, a travel agent adding offsets for lodging emissions to a vacation package... but don't let us limit your thinking!

We're hard at work cranking out more emitters, so stay tuned for updates.

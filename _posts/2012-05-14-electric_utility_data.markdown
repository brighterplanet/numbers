We've just added US electric utilities to our [public data repository](http://data.brighterplanet.com). Our current data includes which zip codes each utility serves (from the [EIA](http://www.eia.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/eia861.html)) and whether the utility has committed to or already begun giving customers access to their own energy information through the [Green Button](http://www.greenbuttondata.org/greenadopt.html) program.

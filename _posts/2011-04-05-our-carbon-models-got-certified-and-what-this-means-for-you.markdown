Today we [announced](http://attachments.brighterplanet.com/press_items/local_copies/76/original/DNV_BP_press_release.pdf) that [Det Norske Veritas](http://www.dnv.com/) (DNV) has reviewed and certified carbon models in our [CM1](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com) web service as complying with the major international carbon standards. This makes Brighter Planet one of the first in the carbon software industry to get a third-party seal of approval for standards compliance, and the first open-source carbon software provider to do so.

The certification process was quite involved. DNV took months to review our carbon models, examining calculation methodologies, source code, data sources, and documentation to check conformity with three global standards: the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, ISO 14064, and the Climate Registry. This is a crucial piece of our strategy to ensure the highest transparency and integrity in enterprise greenhouse gas calculations.

It's big news for Brighter Planet and our clients, because it validates the methodologies and data sources that power the carbon calculations in our [flight](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/models/flight), [automobile](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/models/automobile_trip), [meeting](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/models/meeting), and [lodging](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/models/lodging) modules, among others. Ensuring authoritative carbon accounting practices is becoming increasingly important as the emissions software industry matures, and the report from DNV, the preeminent organization in carbon verification, is a critical step.

Switching over to certified calculations on CM1 is a breeze&mdash;we'll be showing you how in additional blog posts over the course of the week. (Short version: just submit your calculation queries to `certified.carbon.brighterplanet.com` instead of `carbon.brighterplanet.com`.)

We've got a new offset project, and once again it's the first of it's kind for Brighter Planet. The [Rentech Fertilizer Plant](http://brighterplanet.com/projects/23) project supports a new N<sub>2</sub>O destruction system at midwestern fertilizer plant, and is certified under the [Climate Action Reserve](http://climateactionreserve.org).

Rentech's fertilizer plant in East Dubuque, Illinois produces nitric acid and ammonia, two of the main ingredients in fertilizer. The plant used to release Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), a greenhouse gas about [three hundred times more powerful](http://brighterplanet.com/entries/7) than CO<sub>2</sub>, as a byproduct of the nitric acid production process. With this project the tail gas from nitric acid production is piped through a special chamber where a catalyst converts between 95% and 99% of the N<sub>2</sub>O into nitrogen and oxygen. A continuous emissions monitoring system directly measures the amount of N<sub>2</sub>O in the tail gas exiting the chamber to ensure the catalyst is functioning effectively.

This project is the first of its kind in the United States and serves as an example of how the fertilizer industry can reduce the impact of its operations while continuing to serve the needs of farmers.
